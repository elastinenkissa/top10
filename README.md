# Top 10
Top 10 is a small web application created using React with TypeScript for a job interview.

This web application only has a frontend which was made from scratch. It utilizes React context for global state management (search query) and custom hooks for data fetching. The data is fetched from an external API (The Movie Database API).

The preview of this app can be found <a href="https://nusretwazowski.github.io/top10/">here</a>
(Currently does not work, see `<a href="#todo">Todo</a>`)

# Usage
The application has 2 basic functions:
1. Display top 10 rated TV shows and top 10 rated movies
2. Search for any TV show or movie
